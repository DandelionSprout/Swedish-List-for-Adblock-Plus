# Swedish List for All-Nordic filterlist sets

A conversion to ABP syntax of *[Frellwit's Swedish Filter](https://github.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists)*, since that list does not offer user support for Adblock Plus users. The conversion is incorporated into the "All-Nordic Filters" list versions that are used by Adblock Plus and other adblockers that share more or less the same engine.

Additionally, this conversion removes a lot of entry types that the Adblock Plus developer team is not happy-happy about having in regional lists, such as entries against anti-adblock, cookie notifications, social buttons, newsletters, paywalls, and push notification prompts.
